Suricata PT Open Ruleset
=====
The [Attack Detection Team](https://twitter.com/AttackDetection) searches for new vulnerabilities and 0-days, reproduces it and creates PoC exploits to understand how these security flaws work and how related attacks can be detected on the network layer. Additionally, we are interested in malware and hackersâ€™ TTPs, so we develop Suricata rules for detecting all sorts of such activities.
